# Jac-Cloud (Deprecated)

!!! warning "Deprecated - Use jac-scale Instead"
    **Jac Cloud has been deprecated and replaced by [jac-scale](../../jac-scale/README.md).**

    jac-scale provides the same functionality with improved Kubernetes integration, better memory management (L1/L2/L3 tiers), and enhanced scalability features.

    - For new projects, use `jac-scale` instead of `jac-cloud`
    - Existing jac-cloud applications should migrate to jac-scale
    - This documentation is preserved for reference only
