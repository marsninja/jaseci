## Introduction

### 1 What is Jac?

Jac is an AI-native full-stack programming language with Python-like syntax that compiles to Python bytecode, JavaScript, and native machine code (C-ABI compatible). It introduces Object-Spatial Programming (OSP) and novel constructs for AI-integrated programming (such as `by llm()`), providing a unified language for backend, frontend, and AI development with full access to the PyPI, npm, and native ecosystems.

```jac
with entry {
    print("Hello, Jac!");
}
```

### 2 The Six Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **AI-Native** | LLMs as first-class citizens through Meaning Typed Programming |
| **Full-Stack** | Backend and frontend in one unified language |
| **Multi-Target** | Compiles to Python bytecode, JS, and native machine code -- full PyPI, npm, and native ecosystem access |
| **Object-Spatial** | Graph-based domain modeling with mobile walkers |
| **Cloud-Native** | One-command deployment with automatic scaling |
| **Human & AI Friendly** | Readable structure for both humans and AI models |

### 3 Designed for Humans and AI

Jac is built for clarity and architectural transparency:

- `has` declarations for clean attribute definitions
- `impl` separation keeps interfaces distinct from implementations
- Structure that humans can reason about AND models can reliably generate

### 4 When to Use Jac

Jac excels at:

- Graph-structured applications (social networks, knowledge graphs)
- AI-powered applications with LLM integration
- Full-stack web applications
- Agentic AI systems
- Rapid prototyping

### 5 Jac vs Python

```jac
obj Person {
    has name: str;
    has age: int;

    def greet() -> str {
        return f"Hi, I'm {self.name}";
    }
}
```

**Key differences from Python:**

| Feature | Python | Jac |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Blocks | Indentation | Braces `{}` |
| Statements | Newline-terminated | Semicolons required |
| Fields | `self.x = x` | `has x: Type;` |
| Methods | `def method():` | `def method() { }` |
| Abilities | N/A | `can` (walker entry/exit only) |
| Types | Optional | Mandatory |

## Getting Started

### 1 Installation

```bash
# Install the Jac toolchain
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaseci-labs/jaseci/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

# Individual plugins
jac install byllm        # LLM integration
# (Production deployment & scaling and full-stack web + native-desktop app
#  building ship with the jac binary -- no separate install)
```

This installs the self-contained `jac` binary -- no Python, pip, or uv required.

### 2 Your First Program

Create a file `hello.jac`:

```jac
def greet(name: str) -> str {
    return f"Hello, {name}!";
}

with entry {
    print(greet("World"));
}
```

Run it:

```bash
jac hello.jac
```

Note: `jac` is shorthand for `jac run`.

### 3 Project Structure

```
my_project/
├── jac.toml           # Project configuration
├── main.jac           # Entry point
├── app.jac            # Full-stack entry (jac-client)
├── models/
│   ├── __init__.jac
│   └── user.jac
└── tests/
    └── test_models.jac
```

**File Extensions:**

| Extension | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `.jac` | Universal Jac code (head module) |
| `.sv.jac` | Server-variant code |
| `.cl.jac` | Client-variant code |
| `.na.jac` | Native-variant code (compiles to LLVM IR, JIT-executed) |
| `.impl.jac` | Implementation file (annex) |
| `.test.jac` | Test file (annex) |

Files sharing the same base name form a single logical module. For example, `mymod.jac`, `mymod.sv.jac`, `mymod.cl.jac`, `mymod.impl.jac`, and `mymod.test.jac` are all part of the `mymod` module. Variant files (`.sv.jac`, `.cl.jac`, `.na.jac`) are automatically discovered and merged during compilation -- see [Variant Modules](functions-objects.md#4-variant-modules) for details. Note that variant extensions are explicit placement pins: plain `.jac` files work for client code too, since the compiler infers client placement from JSX and npm imports.

### 4 Editor Setup

Install the VS Code extension for Jac language support:

```bash
# Start the language server
jac lsp
```

## Language Basics

### 1 Source Code Encoding

Jac source files are UTF-8 encoded. Unicode is fully supported in strings and comments.

### 2 Comments

```jac
# Single-line comment

#* Multi-line
   comment *#

"""Docstring for modules, classes, and functions"""
```

!!! tip "Coming from Python"
    The biggest syntactic differences: Jac uses **braces** `{ }` instead of indentation for blocks, and **semicolons** `;` to terminate statements. Everything else -- variables, control flow, imports -- is very similar to Python.

### 3 Statements and Expressions

All statements end with semicolons:

```jac
with entry {
    x = 5;
    print(x);
    result = compute(x) + 10;
}
```

### 4 Code Blocks

Code blocks use braces:

```jac
with entry {
    if condition {
        statement1;
        statement2;
    }
}
```

### 5 Keywords

Jac keywords are reserved and cannot be used as identifiers:

| Category | Keywords |
|----------|----------|
| **Archetypes** | `obj`, `node`, `edge`, `walker`, `class`, `enum` |
| **Abilities** | `can`, `def`, `init`, `postinit` |
| **Access** | `pub`, `priv`, `protect`, `static`, `override`, `abst`, `Self` |
| **Control** | `if`, `elif`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `match`, `case`, `switch`, `default` |
| **Loop** | `break`, `continue` |
| **Return** | `return`, `yield`, `report`, `skip` |
| **Exception** | `try`, `except`, `finally`, `raise`, `assert` |
| **OSP** | `visit`, `disengage`, `spawn`, `here`, `root`, `visitor` |
| **Module** | `import`, `include`, `from`, `as`, `glob` |
| **Blocks** | `cl` (client), `sv` (server), `na` (native) |
| **Other** | `with`, `test`, `impl`, `sem`, `by`, `del`, `in`, `is`, `and`, `or`, `not`, `async`, `await`, `flow`, `wait`, `lambda`, `props` |

**Note:** The abstract modifier keyword is `abst`, not `abstract` (and not `abs`, which is the built-in absolute-value function).

**Note:** `entry` and `exit` are *contextual* keywords -- they have special meaning only in entry/exit clauses (`with entry`, `can ... with Root exit`) and remain valid as ordinary identifiers (`entry = 5;` is fine).

### 6 Identifiers

Valid identifiers start with a letter or underscore, followed by letters, digits, or underscores.

To use a reserved keyword as an identifier, escape it with a backtick prefix:

```jac
obj Example {
    has `edge: str;  # Backtick-escaped Jac keyword used as identifier
}
```

!!! note "The `any` Special Case"
    Because `any` is a built-in type in Jac, the backtick escape is used as a convention to refer to the Python/Jac built-in **`any()` function**. Always use `` `any `` when you want to call the function and `any` (without a backtick) when referring to the type.

!!! danger
    Backtick escaping cannot smuggle **Python reserved words** (`class`, `lambda`, `import`, `def`, ...) into `has`-field or parameter names -- the compiler rejects them with error **E0067**, because they would break the generated Python underneath. Choose a non-keyword identifier instead (e.g., `has cls: str;` or `has kind: str;`).

!!! note "Special variable references don't need backtick escaping"
    The following are **built-in references**, not regular identifiers. Use them directly without backticks: `self`, `Self`, `super`, `root`, `here`, `visitor`, `init`, `postinit`. `self` is the current instance; `Self` is the enclosing type. For example, write `self.name`, `root ++> node`, and `def init()` -- never `` `self ``, `` `root ``, or `` `init ``.

### 7 Entry Point Variants

Entry points define where code execution begins. Unlike Python's `if __name__ == "__main__"` pattern, Jac provides explicit entry block syntax. Use `entry` for code that always runs, `entry:__main__` for main-module-only code (like tests or CLI scripts), and named entries for exposing multiple entry points from a single file.

!!! tip "Coming from Python"
    Python's `if __name__ == "__main__":` becomes `with entry:__main__ { }`. Plain `with entry { }` runs every time the module loads (like top-level Python code).

```jac
# Default entry - always runs when this module loads
with entry {
    print("Always runs");
}

# Main entry - only runs when this file is executed directly
# Similar to Python's if __name__ == "__main__"
with entry:__main__ {
    print("Only when this file is main");
}
```
