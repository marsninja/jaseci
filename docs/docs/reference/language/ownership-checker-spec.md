# Ownership Fact Schema: what each E13xx guarantees

This is the authoritative statement of what `OwnershipCheckPass` computes, at
what granularity, and what its facts promise. It is the contract document for
the compiler's single-source ownership analysis: the per-code guarantees below
are the *soundness contracts* that diagnostics report on and that backends may
rely on when they consume the stamped facts (#7418). The historical
"diagnostics-only" framing -- backends must never read the checker's results --
is superseded: on the native pathway the required-analysis schedule always runs,
error-severity findings gate codegen, and a clean check is precisely what makes
the facts trustworthy inputs for lowering.

Reference-doc companion pieces: the user-facing feature guide is
[Ownership & Borrowing](ownership-borrowing.md); the
code table is in
[Errors and Warnings](../diagnostics.md#ownership-borrow-errors).

## The three ground rules

**1. Opt-in.** The checker only reasons about bindings the programmer
explicitly tagged -- `own`, `imm`, `linear`, `borrow` / `&` / `&mut` -- plus
allocations lexically inside a `region { ... }` block. An unannotated binding
is invisible to every rule below; annotating one binding never changes what is
reported about another module, function, or unannotated binding. A module with
no annotations and no region opens produces no E13xx diagnostics, ever.
Unannotated code keeps the managed RC/GC floor exactly as before: gradual
adoption is unchanged.

**2. Symbol-level granularity.** The unit of tracking is the *binding* -- a
declared local or parameter, identified by its symbol id. Moves, borrows, and
consumption are facts about names, not about heap objects:

- Field- and index-projections are tracked only back to their base symbol
  (`a.b.c` and `a[i]` are accesses *of `a`*). There is no field-sensitive or
  path-sensitive state: you cannot move `a.b` while keeping `a.c` live.
- There is no interprocedural analysis. A call is handled by its signature
  only: passing an `own`/`linear` value to a call is a consuming move; what the
  callee does internally is checked separately, in the callee.
- There is no alias analysis through managed storage. Once a value is moved
  into a field, container, or graph object (sealed across the membrane), the
  checker's knowledge of it ends; reading it back yields an ordinary managed
  value with no ownership state.
- Flow-sensitivity is per-function CFG dataflow over those symbol ids (the
  `in_consumed` / live-borrow sets), solved on the compiler's shared worklist
  framework (`passes/main/dataflow.jac`). Branches merge conservatively:
  consumed on *some* path means consumed at the join.

**3. Facts once, consumed everywhere.** The analysis is computed exactly once
per module by the core pass; diagnostics emission and backend policy are both
thin consumers of the same facts. Whether diagnostics are *displayed* is a
property of the compile request (`CompileOptions.emit_diagnostics` /
`type_check`), and can never change what is generated -- display-neutrality is
enforced by construction, not by prohibition.

## Per-code guarantees (the fact schema's soundness contracts)

For each code: if the checker ran over a function and did not emit it, this is
what diagnostics have verified and what a consumer of the facts may rely on --
always within the symbol-level, intraprocedural bounds above.

| Code | Guarantee when clean |
|------|----------------------|
| `E1301` | No tagged `own`/`linear` binding is read on any CFG path after the move that consumed it, unless it was reassigned (revived) in between. |
| `E1302` | No point in the function has two live borrows of one owner where at least one is `&mut`. Shared borrows may coexist; a mutable borrow is exclusive. |
| `E1303` | An owner is never written (assigned, field/subscript-written through, or `&mut`-reborrowed) while a shared `&` borrow of it is live. |
| `E1304` | No borrow outlives its owner's scope: if a borrow binding declared in an outer scope points at an owner declared in an inner one, the owner's scope end is flagged. |
| `E1305` | Every `linear` binding is consumed (moved to a final owner, passed on, or sealed into managed storage) at least once before its scope ends. Consuming it *twice* is `E1301`, so a clean function uses each `linear` binding exactly once. Plain `own` is affine -- never consuming it is *not* an error, and E1305 is only ever emitted for `linear`. |
| `E1306` | No `&`/`&mut` value escapes the scope that created it: not returned (except the single-passthrough-parameter case), not stored into a field or subscript slot. Borrows are second-class; there are no lifetimes to solve because escape is banned outright. |
| `E1307` | No reference rooted in an `in <handle> {}` region open outlives the handle: not returned (except via single-region elision on a lone `&Region` parameter), not stored where it outlives the handle (legal outward flows become shared borrows of the handle), not handed to an opaque callee (calls that also receive the handle, safe builtins, methods on region-rooted receivers, and constructors under the open are exempt), not sent across a concurrency boundary while borrows of the handle exist, and not wired into managed topology. Scalar values and `own` reboxes of scalars/strings copy out freely. The bulk free at the handle's drop point therefore cannot create a dangling reference to a region-rooted binding. |
| `E1308` | Every value crossing a `flow`/`thread_run` send boundary is statically race-free at the binding level: a deep-immutable scalar (`int`/`float`/`bool`/`str`/`bytes`, sendable by value), a deep-immutable `imm`, or an `own`/`linear` moved into the boundary. Live borrows and unconsumed `linear` bindings do not cross. `wait` is a receive, not a send: the payload crossed at `flow` time, so reading a handle in `wait` is not a boundary crossing. |
| `E1309` | An `imm` binding is never mutated *through that binding*: no reassignment, no field/subscript write through it, no `&mut` of it. (It is the binding that is deep-immutable; the checker cannot see writes through a separately-obtained managed alias.) |

What none of the codes guarantee: memory safety of unannotated code, absence
of aliasing through the managed graph, cross-function or cross-module
lifetimes, or anything about runtime behaviour. The managed RC/GC floor is
what keeps unchecked code safe; the checker only adds move/borrow discipline
on top for the bindings that asked for it.

## The facts contract (supersedes the diagnostics-only contract)

The analysis stamps documented facts; consumers read them:

- **`Symbol.ownership`** (`OwnershipKind`): written once by `_stamp_ownership`
  from the programmer's annotations; the checker's dataflow annexes consume it,
  as does the sendability rule. Parser-stamped syntax facts
  (`SubTag.ownership` / `UnaryExpr.ownership`) remain available and are what
  survives the JIR cache.
- **`Assignment.na_move_lowerable`**: stamped by the core `RcFactsPass`
  (scheduled in the native codegen slot) from a backward-liveness proof on the
  shared dataflow framework -- a `b = a` alias whose LOCAL source is dead-out
  may lower as a move. The native backend's reference-count elision consumes
  this fact; the former backend-private `RcElisionProofPass` solver is deleted.
- **`Symbol.param_rebound`**: stamped by `RcFactsPass`; drives the backend's
  param-promotion retain decision (formerly an emit-time def-use rescan).

Requirements on the native pathway:

- **The required-analysis schedule always runs** (inference, CFG, static
  analysis, access, ownership, native capability) for native modules,
  independent of whether diagnostics display was requested.
- **Error-severity findings block native codegen.** Type errors, ownership
  E13xx, static-analysis and access errors, and capability E5090s all gate the
  artifact; warnings (portability W6xxx, lint) stay advisory. A program that
  compiles natively has passed the full check -- which is exactly why its
  annotations are trustworthy facts.
- **Display never changes codegen.** Builds with and without diagnostics
  display produce bit-identical binaries, because the analyses run either way
  and only `emit_diagnostics` differs.

The corollary for contributors: a backend must consume stamped facts, never
re-derive them. If a lowering decision needs a semantic fact that is not yet
stamped, add it to the core analysis (or a core pass on the shared dataflow
framework) and consume it -- do not build a private shadow analysis in the
backend.

## Scheduling

The pass runs in the required check schedule (it needs symbols resolved),
after symbol resolution, inference, and CFG construction, on every
`type_check` compile *and* on every native-module compile. `RcFactsPass` runs
in the native codegen schedule immediately before IR generation, so its
stamps are always freshly computed in-process for the module being lowered.
The checker's cost is proportional to the number of *annotated* symbols;
unannotated modules exit the E13xx analyses early (the move-elision liveness
proof runs regardless, as it serves unannotated code too).
