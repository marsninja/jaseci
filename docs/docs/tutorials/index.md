## Start Here

New to Jac? Begin with **[Build an AI Day Planner](first-app/build-ai-day-planner.md)** -- a 6-part guide that takes you from zero to a multi-user AI-powered app, teaching the full language along the way:

| Part | What You'll Build | Concepts |
|------|-------------------|----------|
| 1: First Lines of Jac | Hello World | Syntax basics, types, functions, control flow |
| 2: Modeling Data | Task data model | Nodes, graphs, root, edges |
| 3: Backend API | HTTP endpoints | `def:pub`, imports, enums, collections |
| 4: Reactive Frontend | Working UI | Client-side code, JSX, reactive state |
| 5: AI Features | Smart categorization + shopping list | `by llm()`, `obj`, `sem`, structured output |
| 6: Walkers & Auth | Multi-user production app | Walkers, abilities, authentication, multi-file |

!!! note "First App vs Full-Stack Tutorials"
    **Build an AI Day Planner** is a self-contained introduction to the full Jac language -- build one app across six parts, learning every major concept as you go. **Full-Stack Apps** (below) is a deep-dive into each concept individually. New to Jac? Start with the Day Planner. Want to understand a specific topic (routing, state, auth)? Use the Full-Stack tutorials as targeted reference.

## Prerequisites

Before starting tutorials, ensure you have:

- [x] Jac installed (`pip install jaseci`)
- [x] Completed the [Quick Guide](../quick-guide/index.md)
- [x] A code editor (VS Code with Jac extension recommended)

**Assumed knowledge:**

- **Python familiarity required** -- Jac supersets Python; you should be comfortable with functions, classes, and type annotations
- **React/JSX familiarity helpful** -- for full-stack tutorials, basic component and hook knowledge helps
- **Web development basics helpful** -- HTTP, REST, frontend/backend separation

For AI tutorials, you'll also need:

- [x] An LLM API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google)

## How to Use These Tutorials

1. **Follow in order** within each path - tutorials build on each other
2. **Type the code** yourself - don't just copy-paste
3. **Experiment** - modify examples to test your understanding
4. **Check the reference** - link to [Language Reference](../reference/language/index.md) for details
