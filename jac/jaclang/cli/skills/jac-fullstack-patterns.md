description: Wiring `main.jac` as the entry for a fullstack Jac app - server-endpoint registration, client mount, calling walkers from the client (`root spawn`), the `sv import` rules that tie `.cl.jac` to `.sv.jac`, endpoint caching, and `[serve]` config. Load when starting a new app, adding the FIRST server endpoint to a client-only app, creating a new `.sv.jac`, or debugging how the top-level pieces connect. Pair with `jac-sv-endpoints` (write the endpoints), `jac-cl-components` (write the UI), `jac-scaffold` (bootstrap a new project).

A fullstack Jac app has three files: `main.jac` (entry + registry), `services/*.sv.jac` (endpoints + types), `components/**/*.cl.jac` (UI). `main.jac` mixes contexts - server imports first (plain, no block; server is the default), then a `cl { ... }` block holds the client section.

```jac
import from services.recipe {
    ApiResponse, RecipePayload,
    save_profile, list_recipes,
}

cl {
    import ".styles.global.css";
    import from .components.AppShell { AppShell }

    def:pub app() -> JsxElement {
        return <AppShell />;
    }
}
```

## Two call styles: function RPC vs walker spawn

The client reaches the server two ways, with OPPOSITE argument rules:

| | `def:pub` function RPC | walker spawn |
|---|---|---|
| call form | `await save_profile(name, email)` | `result = root spawn add_task(title=t);` |
| argument rule | **POSITIONAL only** - kwargs send an empty body → 422 | **KWARGS only** - they map to the walker's `has` fields |
| return value | the function's return value (typed, hydrated) | a result object: read `result.reports` |

**Function RPC:** `save_profile(a, b)` works; `save_profile(name=a, email=b)` → `422 Field required`. The caller's *variable names* become the JSON keys, so they must exactly match the server parameter names: if the server is `def:pub get_moves(game_id: str, row: int, col: int)`, calling `get_moves(game_id, r, c)` 422s - rename the caller's locals to `row`/`col`.

**Walker spawn** (the docs' primary backend pattern): kwargs fill the walker's `has` fields; everything the walker `report`s lands in `result.reports` (a list - first report is `result.reports[0]`). Both styles are async on the client - inside an async context the spawn awaits implicitly:

```
async def handle_add() {
    result = root spawn add_task(title=title);      # kwargs -> `has title: str;`
    if result.reports and len(result.reports) > 0 {  # len(), NOT .reports.length (E1030)
        tasks = tasks + [result.reports[0]];
    }
}
```

## Typed objects cross the boundary

Return `node`/`obj` instances (or `report` them from walkers) directly - no manual dicts. The compiler generates wire stubs so the client receives **hydrated typed instances**: `def:pub get_tasks -> list[Task] { return [root-->][?:Task]; }` gives the client real `Task` objects with typed attribute access. Works for `obj`, `node`, `enum`, `list[T]`, nested objects, and in both directions (typed args serialize back). Use `jid(task)` for stable list keys and identity checks - graph identity survives the wire.

## Rules

- **`main.jac` is the server's endpoint registry.** EVERY `.sv.jac` you create needs its functions AND obj/node types added to `main.jac`'s `import from services.X { ... }` block. Missing = `404 Not Found` on RPC calls. Adding an endpoint is ALWAYS a 2-file change (the `.sv.jac` + the `main.jac` import) - especially easy to miss when extending a client-only app.
- **In `main.jac`: plain `import from services.X { ... }`** (NEVER `sv import`). Plain = in-process import; the endpoint registers at `/function/<name>` (walkers at `/walker/<name>`).
- **In `.cl.jac`: `sv import from ..services.X { ... }`** (prefix required). Generates the JS RPC stub. Plain `import from` to a `.sv.jac` fails the Vite build with `Could not resolve "services/X.js"`.
- **Always `await` `sv import` function calls.** Stubs are `async` - `items = fetch_items()` assigns a `Promise` → silent runtime crash. `items = await fetch_items()`.
- **`sv import` in `main.jac` = microservice RPC.** Spawns a separate provider server process; session cookies don't cross → `def:priv` fails with `401 Unauthorized`. Only use for actual microservices.
- **Import obj/node TYPES alongside functions** in both places - the server needs them registered, and the client needs them to type `has` state (`has posts: list[Post] = [];`).
- **Reader responses are cached for 60s.** The client runtime auto-classifies endpoints: **readers** (no side effects) get an LRU response cache (60s TTL, deduped concurrent calls); calling any **writer** invalidates all cached reads; login/logout clears the cache. This is why a read can look "stale" after out-of-band changes (another tab, server-side mutation) - it's the cache, not your code. Mutate through a writer endpoint and re-read, and it refreshes automatically.
- **`[serve] base_route_app = "app"` serves the client at `/`.** Without it the app lives at `/cl/app` and `/` stays the JSON API index. Scaffolded client projects set it by default. The server's SPA catch-all then serves the app HTML for clean URLs (BrowserRouter), excluding API prefixes (`cl/`, `walker/`, `function/`, `user/`, `static/`).
- **Client entry is `def:pub app()`** - lowercase. Runtime mounts the literal name. Don't wrap it in `with entry { }`.
- **Global vs scoped CSS:** import app-wide CSS once in `main.jac`'s `cl { }` block; component CSS goes in a same-basename `Comp.style.css` annex (auto-scoped, no import). No `*` reset in Tailwind projects (breaks Preflight spacing). See `jac-cl-styling`.
- **Start with `jac start --dev main.jac`** (NOT deprecated `jac serve`). HMR reloads only `.cl.jac` files - `.sv.jac` / `glob` changes need a full restart (`pkill -f "jac start"` then restart). Kill stale `jac start` processes first: a held port makes the new server grab the next port while Vite's proxy still points at the old one → all RPC calls fail.
- **Build failures print structured `JAC_CLIENT_00x` diagnostics** (001 missing npm dep, 003 client syntax error, 004 unresolved import); set `JAC_DEBUG=1` (or `[plugins.client] debug = true`) for raw Vite output. Compiled JS for inspection: `.jac/client/compiled/`.
