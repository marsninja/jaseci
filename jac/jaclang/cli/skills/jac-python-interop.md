description: Using Python from Jac and Jac from Python - PyPI imports (numpy, pandas, sklearn), typing the untyped boundary, inline ::py:: blocks, importing .jac modules into Python scripts, jaclang.lib library mode (Node/Walker/spawn/root), jac2py. Load when mixing .jac and .py code or pulling in any PyPI package.
---

Jac compiles to Python bytecode, so the entire PyPI ecosystem is directly importable - no wrappers, no FFI. The bridge works in both directions: `.jac` files import `.py` modules with normal `import` syntax, and `.py` files import `.jac` modules through an import hook.

## Python → Jac source (use any PyPI package)

```jac
import numpy as np;
import from sklearn.linear_model { LinearRegression }   # deep dotted paths work
import from os.path { join, basename }

with entry {
    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
    print(f"Mean: {np.mean(arr)}");
    model = LinearRegression();
    _ = model;
}
```

Local `.py` files import the same way: `import validators;` then `validators.validate_title(t)` - drop the file next to your `.jac` sources, zero config.

**The untyped boundary:** untyped Python returns arrive as `any`, and Jac's strict rule blocks `any` from flowing silently into typed destinations (E1001). Three fixes - type the source (`.pyi` stub), accept-and-narrow with `isinstance`, or `value as Type` cast. Full playbook in `jac-types`.

## Inline Python: `::py::` blocks

Paste Python verbatim between `::py::` fences (Python indentation rules inside); names defined there are callable from surrounding Jac:

```jac
::py::
def legacy_validate(title):
    """Kept as-is from an old Python codebase."""
    return len(title) > 3 and title.strip() != ""
::py::

with entry {
    if legacy_validate("Build API") {
        print("valid");
    }
}
```

Use for: preserving tested legacy code during migration, Python-only API shapes (metaclasses, exotic decorators). Do NOT use for simple imports (plain `import` works) or new logic that could be Jac - inline Python is invisible to the Jac type checker.

## Jac → Python scripts (import hook + `jaclang.lib`)

A `.pth` file installed with jaclang registers the import hook at Python startup, so `.jac` modules import with zero setup. Graph primitives come from `jaclang.lib`:

```python
import jaclang                      # only needed if the auto-hook is missing (editable/dev installs)
from graph_tools import Task, Collector       # graph_tools.jac, imported directly
from jaclang.lib import spawn, root, connect

t1 = Task(name="deploy", priority=1)
connect(root(), t1)                 # root is a FUNCTION here - call it
w = Collector()
spawn(w, root())
print(w.names)
```

Library-mode basics: archetypes subclass `Node` / `Edge` / `Walker` / `Obj`, abilities are `@on_entry` methods, `connect(a, b)` ≈ `a ++> b`, `spawn(walker, node)` ≈ `node spawn walker`. **`root` is a function in library mode** (`root()`), the opposite of `.jac` source where bare `root` is the keyword and `root()` warns W0062.

`jac jac2py file.jac` prints the equivalent library-mode Python - the fastest way to learn the `jaclang.lib` API or to hand a module to a Python-only team.

## Pitfalls

- **Entry scripts can't use `..` relative imports.** A file run directly with `jac run` is a top-level script, so `import from ..lib { helper }` inside it fails with `attempted relative import with no known parent package`. Use relative imports *between* package modules; from the entry script, import by absolute path.
- **`import:py` does not exist** - plain `import numpy as np;` is the Python-import syntax. See `jac-core-cheatsheet`.
- Brace imports take no trailing `;` (`import from x { y }`); module imports do (`import x;`).
- Don't reach into `jaclang.jac0core.jaclib` (what generated code uses internally) - the public, stable surface is `jaclang.lib`.
- In native (`.na.jac`) code the rules differ - only a Python-congruent stdlib subset is available and unsupported imports fail at compile time; see `jac-native`.
