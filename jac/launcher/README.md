# jac single-binary launcher (Zig, dlopen embed)

`jac` is built as a Zig project (`jac/build.zig`) that produces **one
self-contained executable**: a tiny native launcher with the jaclang runtime +
a private CPython appended as a payload. It needs **no system Python, uv, or
pip** at install or runtime.

Instead of statically linking CPython (reconstructing 100+ objects, bundled
archives and OS frameworks from pbs's `PYTHON.json`), the launcher **`dlopen`s a
shared `libpython` at runtime** -- the same way jac-native loads LLVM/native code
(llvmlite + ctypes, see `jaclang/jac0core/native_marshal.jac`). This keeps the
build trivial: the launcher links only libc, with **zero Python at build time**.

## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `launcher.zig` | Process entry. Materializes the payload, `dlopen`s the bundled libpython, `dlsym`s ~6 `Py_*` functions, runs the jaclang boot dance. No `@cImport`, no Python headers. |
| `runtime.zig` | Pure-Zig payload materialization: trailer parse, cache resolution, gzip+tar extract into `~/.cache/jac/rt/<hash16>-<pathhash>` (path-folded so co-located checkouts don't collide), stale GC. Unit-tested (`zig build test`). |
| `pack.zig` | Build-time tool: `[stub][payload.tar.gz][trailer]` -> final `jac`. |
| `payload.zig` | Build-time payload tool (pure std): `fetch-pbs` (HTTP + verify + zstd-extract a python-build-standalone tree), `fetch-typeshed` (HTTP tarball + sha256-verify the stdlib stubs), `mkpayload` (stage CPython + jaclang site, tar+gzip). Shells out only to the fetched pbs python for pip + JIR precompile. Replaces the old bash/curl/git/zstd/tar scripts. |
| `tests/fixture.zig` | base64 tar.gz fixture for the materialize unit test. |

## Binary shape

```
jac = [ launcher stub (links libc only) ][ runtime.tar.gz ][ trailer ]
trailer = "JACBIN01" | payload_len(u64 LE) | sha256_hex(64)   (80 bytes, at EOF)
```

Payload, materialized to `<cache>/rt/<hash16>-<pathhash>/` on first run (the
`<pathhash>` folds in the binary's own path so two co-located checkouts with
identical payloads get distinct trees):

```
python/lib/libpython3.14.{dylib,so}   <- dlopened (RTLD_NOW|RTLD_GLOBAL)
python/lib/python3.14/                 <- stdlib (incl. lib-dynload: extension .so)
site/                                  <- jaclang + _jac_finder + llvmlite
```

> Unlike a static embed, the shared interpreter loads its C extensions from
> `lib-dynload/` on demand, so that directory is **kept** (a static build prunes
> it). The launcher points the interpreter at this tree via `PYTHONHOME`.

## Build

```bash
cd jac

zig build test                       # launcher unit tests (no libpython needed)
zig build stub                       # just the launcher (links only libc)

# Full binary, one command: zig build runs payload.zig to fetch the pbs tree +
# typeshed over HTTP, assemble the payload, and pack it onto the stub.
zig build                            # -> zig-out/bin/jac
./zig-out/bin/jac --version

zig build -Dpayload-progress         # same, but stream the payload build live
zig build -Dpayload=/tmp/p.tar.gz    # pack a prebuilt payload (skip fetch+assemble)
```

Build-time host deps: just `zig` + network (plus an optional, best-effort
`strip` to shrink the unstripped pbs libpython ~245 MiB -> ~20 MiB; the build
still works without it). `payload.zig` does HTTP, integrity, (de)compression and
tar in std; it shells out only to the freshly-fetched pbs python (pip + JIR
precompile, which need a real CPython). The launcher
cross-compiles to any target with `zig build -Dtarget=...`
(`x86_64-linux-gnu.2.17`, `aarch64-macos`, ...) -- `dlopen` is uniform across
Linux (`.so`) and macOS (`.dylib`), no per-OS framework enumeration. The pbs
archive is only a payload input; it is never linked.

## Status / follow-ups

- **Validated on macos-aarch64**: `jac --version` and `jac run` (obj + methods +
  comprehensions) work from a clean `HOME`; warm start ~0.3s.
- **Precompiled JIR bundle ships** (the `mkpayload` precompile step): 300+
  modules precompiled, so a cold run does **0 live compilations** (vs ~100
  without the bundle). The precompiler intentionally leaves a few core modules
  (`jir`, `archetype`, `modresolver`) to compile at runtime and exits non-zero;
  the tool judges success by JIR produced (>=300), not the exit code.
- **Sealed runtime (the only bundled shape; #6852 Phase 4 / #7135).** A bundled
  `zig build` payload is **fully source-free** -- no importable `.jac` and no
  `.py`. It boots from a sealed JIR *image*: `_precompiled/MANIFEST.json` maps
  module fullnames to JIR (full compiler) + frozen `.jbc` (the jac0core
  bootstrap layer, incl. `modresolver`), the stdlib + jaclang `.py` ship as
  sourceless unchecked-hash `.pyc` (PEP 552), and jaclang's own `JacMetaImporter`
  resolves its modules by name from the manifest **first** -- no filesystem
  `.jac` probing, no per-load source re-hash. Trust moves to build time (the
  manifest) + the existing payload sha256 trailer; the runtime fail-closes on a
  manifest/tag/JIR-format mismatch rather than degrading to live compilation.
  Sealing is strict: any precompile failure aborts the build.
  - `--seal` (passed by `mkpayload` for every bundled build) does it all:
    freeze the bootstrap layer, emit the manifest, strip the sealed `.jac`, and
    compile the stdlib + jaclang `.py` to sourceless `.pyc`. It is inert only
    where there is nothing to seal: `-Ddev`/`-Djaclang-dir` (linked source, the
    compiler is served from a live tree) and `-Dskip-precompile`. `-Ddebug-src`
    embeds source text in each JIR so tracebacks still show source lines
    source-free (via the loader's `get_source` + `linecache`); release omits it.
  - Same image, two products: `jac bundle --target sealed` emits the identical
    manifest+JIR image for a **user app** (source-free), loadable in a host jac
    via `jaclang.jac0core.sealed.register_image(<dir>/_precompiled)`;
    `jac bundle --target binary` wraps that image onto a copy of the running
    sealed binary (trailer surgery: rebuild the gzip'd tar with the app under
    `site/<app>/` + a `site/jac_app.json` boot marker, re-emit
    `[stub][payload][JACBIN01 trailer]`), yielding a self-contained executable
    that `cli_boot` dispatches to instead of the jac CLI.
- **Linux**: the staged shared lib is named `libpython3.14.so` (pbs may ship
  `libpython3.14.so.1.0` -- `mkpayload` dereferences it to the bare name).
